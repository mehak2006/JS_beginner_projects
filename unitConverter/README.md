# Metric/Imperial Unit Conversion

A simple, responsive web app to convert between **Metric** and **Imperial** units of **Length**, **Volume**, and **Mass**.

This project was built as part of my learning journey following the [Scrimba Frontend Career Path](https://scrimba.com/), with my own customizations and added features.

## 🚀 Features

- **Length Conversion** (Meters ⇄ Feet)  
- **Volume Conversion** (Liters ⇄ Gallons)  
- **Mass Conversion** (Kilograms ⇄ Pounds)  
- **Light/Dark Mode Toggle** 🌙 ☀️ (affects only the conversions section, not the whole page)  
- Fully responsive layout with flexbox

---

## 🌓 Light/Dark Mode Toggle

- A toggle button in the top-right corner of the title section lets you switch between **Light** and **Dark** themes.  
- The dark mode changes the **background and text colors** of the conversions section only, so the header retains its own style.  
- Toggle button automatically updates its icon:  
  - ☀ → Light Mode  
  - 🌙 → Dark Mode
